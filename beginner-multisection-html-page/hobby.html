        <p>
          Blisargon Demogorgon is the dark-psychedelic alter ego of producer and
          performer Valentino Trenchev, crafting music that bends reality and
          pulls listeners into shadowy, immersive worlds. Known for his deep,
          driving basslines, crawling atmospheres, and story-driven nocturnal
          sets, Blisargon creates a sound experience designed to transform the
          dancefloor into a ritual space. His performances are a fusion of
          psychedelic intensity, precise sound design, and cinematic darkness -
          a journey where every track unfolds like a chapter in a twisted myth.
          <br />
          In the year of 1999 Valentino started to produce his own tracks, and
          he started out with Fruityloops. Valentino didn’t seem to find the
          right power in order to express what was going on in his mind, and
          turned his mind to Mod plug tracker, Cubase, Logic and finally decided
          to stick with Cubase. Valentino’s first track got released in 2003 on
          Nabi records and also after he released many tracks in compilations on
          labels like Stone age, Ketuh, Doof, Alkaloid, Golden dawn, Peak,
          Kagdila, Acidance, Manic dragon, Hypnotica, Digital Psionics,
          Bhooteshwara, Plutonic, Killah Tea, Pixan, Shaman Films, Pleiadian,
          Zaikadelic, Psylife, Divine Balance, Samsara, Goanmantra, Tremors
          Underground, Mental Mekanix, Evil Knivel, Purple Hexagon, 2to6,
          Caffix, Blitz Studio, Urban Antidote, Shiva Squad, Triptec and two
          albums were released one by Inpsyde media records in 2007 called ”Book
          of Magic” and one collaborations album released by Bhooteshwara
          records in 2010 called ”Ruthless Illusions”.The music that streams out
          of this project is generally deep and powerful with a lot of leads and
          rhythms supported by mystic atmospheres.
